# Data Science Midterm Project

## Project/Goals

## Process
### Importing and compiling data from .json files
- wrote one funcition to iterate through the data folder and extract information into a dataframe, and another to expand the tags list into columns, with partial One-Hot encoding applied, using list comprehension. 

### (your step 2)
- (details)
### (your step 2)

## Results
(fill in how your model performed)

## Challenges 
- writing the import funtions was tricky; I (MB) had some issues getting the iterator to skip over None values rather than breaking, and then with the fact that the functions in the .py file needed to import modules internally. 

## Future Goals
(what would you do if you had more time?)
